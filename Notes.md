Media Queries 

`@media` is a CSS at-rule that is used to apply specific styles based on the characteristics of the
device or viewport. It allows you to create responsive designs by targeting different screen sizes,
resolutions, and orientations. By using `@media`, you can define different styles for different
devices, ensuring that your website looks good and functions well across various platforms.

Cookies (4kb) :  1000 lines
Cookies are small text files stored in your browser by websites you visit. They help websites remember information about you between visits.


1 mb = 1024kb


Cookies = user identity & authentication between browser and server

webstorage (5mb)
Web Storage = frontend application state & user preferences

1. local storage 

2. session storage


Local
1. Local storage is a web storage feature that allows websites
to store data in the browser with no expiration time.
2. This means the data remains available even after the user closes
and reopens the browser or the system is restarted. 
3. It is typically used to save long-term data such as
user preferences, themes, or login tokens.

session
1. Session storage is also a browser-based storage method, 
but it only stores data for the duration of a single browser tab session. 
2. Once the tab is closed, all session storage data is automatically deleted. 
3. It is useful for storing temporary data like form inputs or 
navigation steps that don’t need to persist beyond the current session. 
4. Unlike local storage, session storage is not shared across 
tabs — each tab has its own session. 

Git :- 
Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code, save different versions of your project, and work with others without overwriting each other’s work. It allows you to create branches, experiment safely, and easily go back to older versions whenever needed.

Git -> Tool for version control (local machine).

GitHub -> Website (by microsoft) to store & manage Git repositories online.
